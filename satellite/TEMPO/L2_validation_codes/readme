This folder contains codes for comparison between TEMPO L2 retrievals of total ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and formaldehyde columns and corresponding retrievals from Pandora. Ozone validation code also uses DSCOVR EPIC L2 total O3 column.

Current versions are based on TEMPO L2 V03 versions of the corresponding product. They do take into account quality flags from either TEMPO or Pandara data sets. They also reflect the most recent changes in the Pandora web site, https://data.ovh.pandonia-global-network.org/, from which Pandora data are downloaded.
