The Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network (TOLNet) is an interagency network initiated by
NASA, NOAA, and EPA in 2011 with the goal of enhancing our tropospheric ozone measurement capabilities.
Ozone lidars within TOLNet provide accurate observations under both daytime and nighttime conditions
and generate consistent, long-term datasets. Most of the instruments are portable and
have been deployed previously in air quality campaigns in coordination with federal,
state and local agency’s interests.
